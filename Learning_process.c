// Learn C
// C is a general-purpose programming language that has been widely used for over 50 years.

// C is very powerful; it has been used to develop operating systems, databases, applications, etc.


// C Introduction >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

// What is C?
// C is a general-purpose programming language created by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell Laboratories in 1972.

// It is a very popular language, despite being old. The main reason for its popularity is because it is a fundamental language in the field of computer science.

// C is strongly associated with UNIX, as it was developed to write the UNIX operating system.



// Why Learn C?
// It is one of the most popular programming languages in the world
// If you know C, you will have no problem learning other popular programming languages such as Java, Python, C++, C#, etc, as the syntax is similar
// C is very fast, compared to other programming languages, like Java and Python
// C is very versatile; it can be used in both applications and technologies


// Difference between C and C++
// C++ was developed as an extension of C, and both languages have almost the same syntax
// The main difference between C and C++ is that C++ support classes and objects, while C does not



// C Get Started >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

// Get Started With C
// To start using C, you need two things:

// A text editor, like Notepad, to write C code
// A compiler, like GCC, to translate the C code into a language that the computer will understand
// There are many text editors and compilers to choose from. In this tutorial, i will use VScode as the text editor and GCC as the compiler.



// C Install IDE
// An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is used to edit AND compile the code.

// Popular IDE's include Code::Blocks, Eclipse, and Visual Studio. These are all free, and they can be used to both edit and debug C code.

// Note: Web-based IDE's can work as well, but functionality is limited.

// I will use visual studio in this tutorial.

// you can also use Code::Blocks, which we believe is a good place to start.

// You can find the latest version of Codeblocks at http://www.codeblocks.org/. Download the mingw-setup.exe file, which will install the text editor with a compiler.


// C Quickstart
// Let's create our first C file.

// Open Codeblocks and go to File > New > Empty File.

// Write the following C code and save the file as myfirstprogram.c 

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  printf("Hello World!");
  return 0;
}

// Don't worry if you don't understand the code above - we will discuss it in detail in later chapters. For now, focus on how to run the code.
// now run the code and you should get this output.

// Hello World!

// Congratulations! You have written and executed your first C program.
